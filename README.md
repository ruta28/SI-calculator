Simple Interest Calculator

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple interest calculator that computes the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified period of time at a given rate of interest.

The calculator uses the standard formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

---

## 🚀 Features
- Calculates simple interest instantly
- Accepts principal amount, rate of interest, and time period as input
- Displays the calculated interest clearly
- Lightweight and easy to use

---

## 🧮 Formula Used

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **R** = Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T** = Time (in years)
- **SI** = Simple Interest

---

## 💻 Example

If:
- Principal = 10,000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:

Simple Interest = (10000 × 5 × 2) / 100  
Simple Interest = 1000
